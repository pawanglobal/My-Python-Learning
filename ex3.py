#math operations work according to acronym PEMDAS (parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction)

#if you want to find something you can write a program

#You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python.

#Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents

#Python calls any number with a decimal point a float.

#How does % work? Another way to say it is, “X divided by Y with J remaining.” For example, “100
#divided by 16 with 4 remaining.” The result of % is the J part, or the remaining part
